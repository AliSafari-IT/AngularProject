                Our first mission is to build the backbone of our Employee Management System. This phase is all
                about mastering the essentials and setting a strong foundation. We're focusing on creating a
                simple yet effective application to manage employee records, which will include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listing all employees – like a roll call for your digital workforce.</li>
                <li>Adding a new employee – because growing teams are happy teams.</li>
                <li>Editing an existing employee – keeping everything up-to-date.</li>
                <li>Deleting an employee – for when it's time to say goodbye.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This stage is crucial for getting to grips with Angular's core concepts. We're diving into the
                Angular CLI to make our developer lives easier, experimenting with Components for building our
                app's structure, and playing around with Modules for organization. We'll also explore Data
                Binding to make our app interactive, Directives to add some special behavior to our HTML,
                Services for business logic, HTTP Client for server communication, and some basic Routing to
                navigate around our app. It's like the Swiss Army knife of Angular development!

                As we journey further into the depths of Angular, we reach the thrilling realm of Advanced Features and Patterns. This is where we push the boundaries, exploring the more intricate and powerful capabilities of Angular to create a truly cutting-edge application.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Our mission is to delve into and master the advanced features of Angular, elevating our Employee Management System to new heights of innovation and functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Features to Implement:</strong></p>
                <ul class="sub-group">
                    <li>Utilizing Angular Elements to create Web Components, which allows for encapsulation and reusability of custom elements in our app and beyond.</li>
                    <li>Implementing dynamic component loading, giving us the flexibility to load components on the fly based on user interactions or other conditions.</li>
                    <li>Exploring advanced RxJS patterns to handle complex asynchronous operations, enhancing the reactive nature of our application.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Concepts to Learn:</strong> We're set to learn about Angular Elements and how they revolutionize the way we build and distribute UI components. We'll also dive into the Dynamic Component Loader for flexible UI rendering and tackle advanced RxJS patterns for sophisticated data handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                By embracing these advanced features and patterns, our Employee Management System will not just be an application; it will be a showcase of modern web development capabilities, setting a benchmark in Angular excellence.
